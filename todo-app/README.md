## Technical Requirements / Notes

- Convert the architecture from **Class Based Components** into **Functional Components**
- Apply styling and layout using React Bootstrap Components
- Ensure the current functionality works unchanged
- Manage state using the `useState()` hook
- Use a `useEffect()` hook to change the title of the browser with the complete/incomplete counts
- Use a `useEffect()` hook to pre-load the seeded To Do Items
- Match the provided mockup for the design
  - Use `react-bootstrap` components and theming
  - Some interactivity notes:
    - Each item in list should show the text of the item as well as the assignee
    - When clicked, toggle the "complete" status of the item.
    - Items should be styled differently when complete/incomplete making their status visually obvious
